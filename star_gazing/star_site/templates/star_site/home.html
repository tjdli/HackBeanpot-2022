        <h3>What Matters to Us?</h3>
        <p>When people think about pollution, they often think about its effect on our oceans and our climate, overlooking the effects of light pollution and its effects on our air. With our project [name], we hope to bring back star gazing as a night time relaxing or fun social activity by allowing people to find locations near them where the stars are most visible.</p>
