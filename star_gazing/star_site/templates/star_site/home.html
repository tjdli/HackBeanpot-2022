        <h3>What Matters to Us?</h3>
        <p>
            When people think about pollution, they often think about its effect on our oceans and our climate, overlooking the effects of light pollution and its effects on our air. With Project ClearSkyes, we hope to bring back star gazing as a night time relaxing or fun social activity by allowing people to find locations near them where the stars are most visible.
        </p>
        <h3>Why a Stargazing Site?</h3>
        <p>
            We wanted to follow the space theme from the Hackbeanpot, but we also wanted to do something that would 
            allow us to help people in our community. After some deliberation, we unanimously agreed on trying to find 
            stars in our area. In Boston, itâ€™s hard to be able to see the stars due to the light pollution caused by 
            the massive population concentrated in one area. By doing this, we hope that we can bring the community 
            together to stop and enjoy something commonly overlooked.
        </p>
        <h3>How We Created Project ClearSkyes:</h3>
        <p>
            We use Django to connect our front-end UI to our back-end data management. 
            To create the user-friendly website, we used HTML and CSS. Then, we use 
            MySQL to create a ClearSkyes Database storing user data and location data.
